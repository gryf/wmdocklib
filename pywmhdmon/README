[WHAT]
pywmhdmon is a WindowMaker dockapp that displays the available space on
up to four of your filesystems. It also contains a bar showing the
current HD activity. It currently only works on system which has a
/proc/stat like file. The application is easy to configure, invoke it
with --help or see the sample rc-file for more information.

[WHY]
As usual, I didn't find a dockapp that fitted me. And I really like to
see the current disk activity since my disks are so quiet that I can't
hear when they work.
