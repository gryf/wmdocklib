[WHAT]
Pywmseti is an WindowMaker dockapp for monitoring your seti@home progress.
The application displays how many workunits you have done and the progress
on the current one. You start/stop the seti@home process by simply clicking
anywhere in the application. It also displays the time spent on the workunit
(or since you started the program if you restart it in the middle of a
workunit). Invoke the program with --help or see the sample rc-file for
more information about customization.

[WHY]
No one of the existing monitors suited my needs. And the more Python the
world gets, the better it'll be! ;)
