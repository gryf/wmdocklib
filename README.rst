wmdocklib
=========

This is a library which was extracted from a pretty much dead `pywmdockapps`_
project, and is meant to help with writing Window Maker dockapps in Python.

Installation
============

The installation from source expect there is a C compiler around, as well as X
and Python headers/dev packages. It might be installed using virtualenv, or
system wide:

.. code::shell-session

   $ python setup.py install

Note, that you'll need C compiler and Xorg dev package to build the C
extension.
