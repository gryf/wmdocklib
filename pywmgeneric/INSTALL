1. If you don't have pywmgeneral installed, install it first. Can be found
   at http://foo.unix.se/pywmdockapps.

2. Copy pywmgeneric.py to somewhere in your path (like ~/bin or
   /usr/local/bin).

3. Create your own pywmgenericrc, save it as ~/.pywmgenericrc. Use the
   sample.pywmgenericrc as reference.

4. Enjoy.
