<h1>pywmdockapps - WindowMaker dockapps written in Python</h1>

<h3>What is this place?</h3>

<p>pywmdockapps is the place to be if you are interested in <a
href="http://www.windowmaker.org">WindowMaker</a>, <a
href="http://dockapps.org">dockapps</a> and <a
href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>.  WindowMaker dockapps are graphical
applications fitting in a 64x64 tile.  they can work in WindowMaker or any
other window manager which can handle WindowMaker style dockapps.
pywmdockapps is a Python library enabling quick development of your own
dockapps plus a small collection of usable examples.
</p>

<p>the included examples are quite untested.  they may work quite well, may
not work at all, may set your computer in flames, even though this is not
the most likely event among the three but you have been warned.  the one on
which most work has been performed is pywmhdmon, but this too is no
guarantee for better functioning.
</p>

<p>
The example dockapps aim at simplicity and consistency. they are as similar
as possible to each other and with no excessive graphics. Since they are
written in Python, it shouldn't be too hard to change something you do not
like about them.  if you do modify things according to your needs and tastes
or if you simply try things out, please share your opinions/changes with the
community, by sending a comment, suggestion, or just drop a note to say that
you have tried it.  see contact information at the bottom of this page.  </p>

<p>you may also consider filing a <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=147660&atid=769418">bug</a>
or <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=147660&atid=769421">change
request</a>...  if your request comes with a diff file, chances are that it
will be processed quickly (a matter of 3/5 days).

<h3>Pywmgeneral</h3>
<p>Pywmgeneral is a library that makes it possible to write WindowMaker
dockapps in <a href='http://www.python.org'>Python</a>. Quite a bit of the
code is taken from the old wmgeneral.c and I have just provided Python wrappers
around these functions. The library also contains a Python part above the
wrappers that ease up argument passing and return values. Also some other
usable methods are provided there.
