[WHAT]
Pywmdatetime is a WindowMaker dockapp for displaying time, date and
some other information. The colors and formats are easy to configure
through the configuration file or as command line arguments. Invoke
the program with --help or see the sample rc-file for more information.

[WHY]
I made it mostly because there was no time displaying app that suited my
needs. I also made it to try out my newly written Python module for that
provides helping functions for making dockapps.
