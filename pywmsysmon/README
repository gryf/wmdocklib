[WHAT]
pywmsysmon is a WindowMaker dockapp that displays your cpu and memory
usages. The upper graph shows your cpu usage history and the lower
"progress bar" shows your current memory usage excluding cached and
buffered data. This program currently only works on systems which got
the /proc/stat and /proc/meminfo files available. Invoke the program
with --help for information about customization.

[WHY]
As usual, I didn't find a dockapp that fitted me.
